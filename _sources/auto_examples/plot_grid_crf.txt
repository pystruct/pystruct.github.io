==================================
Learning interactions on a 2d grid
==================================
Simple pairwise model with arbitrary interactions on a 4-connected grid.
The inputs contain a cross pattern with a separate state for the center.
The crosses are placed randomly in the image and noise is added.

The center state is not encoded in the input, so that the task can not be
solved without pairwise interactions.
