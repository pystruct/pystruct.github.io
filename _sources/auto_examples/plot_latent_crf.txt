===================
Latent Dynamics CRF
===================

Solving a 2d grid problem by introducing latent variable interactions.  The
input data is the same as in plot_grid_crf, a cross pattern.  But now, the
center is not given an extra state. That makes the problem much harder to solve
for a pairwise model.
We can still solve it by introducing latent dynamics. In essence we allow an
additional state with different interactions, that maps to the same state (the
cross) in the ground truth.
