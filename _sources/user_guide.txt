#FIXME make clear what is learned!!

Preliminaries
=============
This page explains how to use the most common of the implemented models.
Each model corresponds to a differents structured prediction task, or possibly
a different parametrization of the model. As such, the training data ``X`` and
training labels ``Y`` has slightly different forms for each model.

A model is given by four functions, ``joint_feature``, ``inference``, ``loss``
and ``loss_augmented_inference``. If you just want to use the included models,
you don't need to worry about these, and can just use the ``fit``, ``predict`` interface
of the learner.

Details on model specification
--------------------------------
For those interested in what happens behind the scenes, or those who might want to
adjust a model, there is a short explanation of these functions for each model below.
For all models, the ``joint_feature(x, y)`` function takes a data point and a
tentative prediction, and computes a continuous vector of a fixed length that
captures the relation between features and label.  Learning (that is
``learner.fit(X, y)``) will learn a parameter vector ``w``, and predictions
will be made using

.. math::

    y^* = \arg \max_{y} w^T \text{joint\_feature}(x, y)

That means the number of parameters in the model is the same as the
dimensionality of ``joint_feature``.

The actual maximization is performed in the ``inference(x, w)`` function, which 
takes a sample ``x`` and a parameter vector ``w`` and outputs a ``y^*``,
which (at least approximately) maximizes the above equation.

The ``loss(y_true, y_pred)`` function gives a numeric loss for a ground truth
labeling ``y_true`` and a prediction ``y_pred``, and finally
``loss_augmented_inference(x, y, w)`` gives an (approximate) maximizer for

.. math::

    y^* = \arg \max_{y} w^T \text{joint\_feature}(x, y) + \text{loss}(y_\text{true}, y)

A good place to understand these definitions is :ref:`multi_class_svm`.

.. note::

    Currently all models expect labels to be integers from 0 to n_states (or
    n_classes).  Starting labels at 1 or using other labels might lead to
    errors and / or incorrect results.

.. _multi_class_svm:

Multi-class SVM
===============
A precursor for structured SVMs was the multi-class SVM by `Crammer and Singer
<http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume2/crammer01a/crammer01a.pdf>`_.
While in practice it is often faster to use an One-vs-Rest approach and an
optimize binary SVM, this is a good hello-world example for structured
predicition and using pystruct.  In the case of multi-class SVMs, in contrast
to more structured models, the labels set Y is just the number of classes, so
inference can be performed by just enumerating Y.

Lets say we want to classify the classical iris dataset. There are three classes and four features::

  >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  >>> iris = load_iris()
  >>> iris.data.shape, iris.target.shape
  ((150, 4), (150,))
  >>> np.unique(iris.target)
  [0, 1, 2]

We split the data into training and test set::

  >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(
  ...     iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.4, random_state=0)

The Crammer-Singer model implemented in :class:`MultiClassClf`.
As this is a simple multi-class classification task, we can pass in training data 
as numpy arrays of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` and training labels as
numpy array of shape (n_samples,) with classes from 0 to 2.

For training, we pick the learner :class:`learners.NSlackSSVM`, which works
well with few samples and requires little tuning::

  >>> from pystruct.learners import NSlackSSVM
  >>> from pystruct.models import MultiClassClf
  >>> clf = NSlackSSVM(MultiClassClf())

The final model the same interface as a scikit-learn estimator::

  >>> clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
  >>> clf.predict(X_test)
  >>> clf.score(X_test, y_test)

Details on the implementation
---------------------------------
For this simple model, the ``joint_feature(x, y)`` is a vector of size ``n_features * n_classes``,
which corresponds to one copy of the input features for each possibly class.
For any given pair ``(x, y)`` the features in ``x`` will be put at the position corresponding
to the class in ``y``.
Correspondingly, the weights that are learned are one vector of length ``n_features`` for each class:
``w = np.hstack([w_class_0, ..., w_class_1])``.

For this simple model, and inference is just the argmax over the inner product with each of these ``w_class_i``::

  >>> y_pred = np.argmax(np.dot(w.reshape(n_classes, n_features), x)) # doctest: +SKIP

To perform max-margin learning, we also need the loss-augmented inference. PyStruct has an optimized version,
but a pure python version would look like this::
   
   >>> scores = np.dot(w.reshape(n_classes, n_features), x) # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> scores[np.arange(n_classes) != y] += 1               # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> y_pred = np.argmax(scores)                           # doctest: +SKIP

Essentialy the response (score / energy) of wrong label is down weighted by 1, the loss of doing an incorrect prediction.

.. _multi_label_svm:

Multi-label SVM
===============
A multi-label classification task is one where each sample can be labeled with any number of classes.
In other words, there are n_classes many binary labels, each indicating whether a sample belongs
to a given class or not. This could be treated as n_classes many independed binary classification
problems, as the scikit-learn OneVsRest classifier does.
However, it might be beneficial to exploit correlations between labels to achieve better generalization.

In the scene classification dataset, each sample is a picture of an outdoor scene,
representated using simple color aggregation. The labels characterize the kind of scene, which can be
"beach", "sunset", "fall foilage", "field", "mountain" or "urban". Each image can belong to multiple classes,
such as "fall foilage" and "field". Clearly some combinations are more likely than others.

We could try to model all possible combinations, which would result in a 2 ** 6
= 64 class multi-class classification problem. This would allow us explicitly model all correlations between labels,
but it would prevent us from predicting combinations that don't appear in the training set.
Even if a combination did appear in the training set, the numer of samples in each class would be very small.
A compromise between modeling all correlations and modelling no correlations is modeling only pairwise correlations,
which is the approach implemented in :class:`MultiLabelClf`.
It creates a graph over ``n_classes`` binary nodes, together with edges between each pair of classes.
Each binary node has represents one class, and therefor will get its own column
in the weight-vector, similar to the crammer-singer multi-class classification.

In addition, there is a pairwise weight betweent each pair of labels.
This leads to a feature function of this form:

If our graph has only 6 nodes, we can actually enumerate all states.
Unfortunately, in general, inference in a fully connected binary graph is in
gerneral NP-hard, so we might need to rely on approximate inference, like loopy believe propagation or AD3.
#FIXME do enumeration! benchmark!!

The input to this model is similar to the :ref:`multi_class_svm`, with the training data ``X_train`` simple
a numpy array of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` and the training labels a binary indicator matrix
of shape ``(n_samples, n_classes)``. 

An alternative to using approximate inference for larger numbers of labels is to not create a fully connected graph,
but restrict ourself to pairwise interactions on a tree over the labels. In the above example of outdoor scenes,
some labels might be informative about others, maybe a beach picture is likely to be of a sunset, while
an urban scene might have as many sunset as non-sunset samples. The optimum tree-structure for such a problem
can easily be found using the Chow-Liu tree, which is simply the maximum weight spanning tree over the graph, where
edge-weights are given by the mutual information between labels on the training set.
You can use the Chow-Liu tree method simply by specifying ``edges="chow_liu"``.
This allows us to use efficient and exact max-product message passing for
inference.

Details on the implementation
---------------------------------

The implementation of the inference for this model creates a graph with unary
potentials (given by the inner product of features and weights), and pairwise
potentials given by the pairwise weight. This graph is then passed to the
general graph-inference, which runs the selected algorithm.


Conditional-Random-Field-like graph models
==========================================
The following models are all pairwise models over nodes, that is they model a labeling of a graph,
using features at the nodes, and relation between neighboring nodes.
The main assumption in these models in PyStruct is that nodes are homogeneous, that is they all
have the same meaning. That means that each node has the same number of classes, and these classes
mean the same thing. In practice that means that weights are shared across all nodes and edges,
and the model adapts via features.
This is in contrast to the :class:`MultiLabelClf`, which builds a binary graph
were nodes mean different things (each node represents a different class), so they do not share weights.

.. note::

    I call these models Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), but this a slight abuse of notation,
    as PyStruct actually implements perceptron and max-margin learning, not maximum likelihood learning.
    So these models might better be called Maximum Margin Random Fields. However, in the computer vision
    community, it seems most pairwise models are called CRFs, independent of the method of training.

ChainCRF
----------
One of the most common use-cases for structured prediction is chain-structured
outputs. These occur naturaly in sequence labeling tasks, such as
Part-of-Speech tagging or named entity recognition in natural language
processing, or segmentation and phoneme recognition in speech processing.

As an example dataset, we will use the toy OCR dataset letters.
In this dataset, each sample is a handwritten word, segmented into letters.
This dataset has a slight oddity, in that the first letter of every word was removed, as it
was capitalized, and therefore different from all the other letters.

Each letter is a node in our chain, and neighboring letters are connected with
an edge. The length of the chain varies with the number of letters in the
word. As in all CRF-like models, the nodes all have the same meaning and share
parameters.

The training data is a list of samples, where each sample is a numpy array of
shape ``(n_nodes, n_features)``, where n_nodes is the length of the input sequence,
that is the length of the word in our case.
Edges don't need to be specified, as the input features are assumed to be in
the order of the nodes in the chain. The default inference method is
max-product message passing on the chain (aka viterbi), which is always exact
and efficient.


# FIXME code


Details on the implementation
---------------------------------

The unary potentials in each node are given as the inner product of the features
at this node (the input image) with the weights (which are shared over all nodes):


The pairwise potentials are identical over the whole chain and given simply by the weights:


In principle it is possible to also use feature in the pairwise potentials.
This is not implemented in the ChainCRF, but can be done using
:class:`EdgeFeatureGraphCRF`.

.. note::

    While pystruct is able to work with chain CRFs, it is not explicitly built with these in mind,
    and there are libraries that optimize much more for this special case, such as seqlearn and CRF++.


GraphCRF
---------
This model is a generalization of the ChainCRF to arbitray graphs.

To the basic model is the same as the ChainCRF model, with unary potentials given
as a shared linear function of the features, and pairwise potentials the same
for all nodes.


EdgeFeatureGraphCRF
-------------------

This model is the most general of the CRF models, and contains all others as a special case.
This model assumes again that the parameters of the potentials are shared over all nodes
and over all edges, but the pairwise potentials are now also computed as a linear function of the features.
