=================================
Comparing PyStruct and SVM-Struct
=================================
This example compares the performance of pystruct and SVM^struct on a
multi-class problem.
For the example to work, you need to install SVM^multiclass and
set the path in this file.
We are not using SVM^python, as that would be much slower, and we would
need to implement our own model in a SVM^python compatible way.
Instead, we just call the SVM^multiclass binary.

This comparison is only meaningful in the sense that both libraries
use general structured prediction solvers to solve the task.
The specialized implementation of the Crammer-Singer SVM in LibLinear
is much faster than either one.

For SVM^struct, the plot show CPU time as reportet by SVM^struct.
For pystruct, the plot shows the time spent in the fit function
according to time.clock.

Both models have disabled constraint caching. With constraint caching,
SVM^struct is somewhat faster, but PyStruct doesn't gain anything.
