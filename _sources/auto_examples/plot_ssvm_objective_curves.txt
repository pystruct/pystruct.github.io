==================================
SSVM Convergence Curves
==================================
Showing the relation between cutting plane and primal objectives,
as well as the different algorithms.
We use exact inference here, so the plots are easier to interpret.

As this is a small toy example, it is hard to generalize
the results indicated in the plot to more realistic settigs.
