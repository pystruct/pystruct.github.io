================================================
Latent SVM for odd vs. even digit classification
================================================
A Latent CRF with one node is the same as a latent multiclass SVM
Using the latent variables, we can learn non-linear models. This is the
same as a simple Latent SVM model. It would obviously be more effiencent
to implement a special case for Latent SVMs so we don't have to run an
inference procedure.

This example uses the scikit-learn digit classification dataset, but poses
the problem as a binary one, discriminating between even and odd digits.
