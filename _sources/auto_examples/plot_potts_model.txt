=================================================
Comparing inference times on a simple Potts model
=================================================

Simple comparison of inference times on a Potts model (smoothing)
on a 2d grid of random noise of 5 classes.

The plots show the label results together with energies (lower is better)
and inference time.
The results are quite representative of the algorithms in general.
AD3 is quite fast and gives good results (identical to lp), while
the general purpose lp solver is too slow for practical purposes.
QPBO is somewhat worse than the other methods, but significantly faster.
Our implementation of max-product message passing is not competative with
the high quality solutions found by AD3.
