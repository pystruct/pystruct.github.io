Plotting the objective and constraint caching in 1-slack SSVM
=============================================================

This example illustrates the use of ``plot_learning.py``, which can be used to
analyze the learning of models.
The file can be call directly as executable or imported as done here.

The task is the same as in plot_directional_grid.py.

Red circles show the primal objective when inference was run.  The green curve
shows the approximated primal objective when finding constraints from the
cache.
The blue shows the objective restricted to the working set. The blue curve is
guaranteed to increase in cutting plane training in each step, and provides a
lower bound on the primal objective.

In contrast to the caching proposed in [1], we do not produce constraints from
the cache as long as possible. A heuristic is used to see whether the cached
constraint is strong enough.

Here training is stopped when the green curve goes below the blue curve.
This means no strong enough constraint could be found. The fact that the
primal objective can go below the cutting plane objective is a result of
approximate inference. The real most violating constraint could not be found,
leading to underestimating the primal objective.

See plot_exact_learning.py for a way to deal with this.
