===========================================
Semantic Image Segmentation on Pascal VOC
===========================================
This example demonstrates learning a superpixel CRF
for semantic image segmentation.
To run the experiment, please download the pre-processed data from:
http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/~amueller/data/

The data consists of superpixels, unary potentials, and the connectivity
structure of the superpixels.
The unary potentials were originally provided by Philipp Kraehenbuehl:
http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/densecrf/

The superpixels were extracted using SLIC.
The code for generating the connectivity graph and edge features will be made
available soon.

This example does not contain the proper evaluation on pixel level, as that
would need the Pascal VOC 2010 dataset.
